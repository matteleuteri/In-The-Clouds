# In-The-Clouds

This is another game I am making to learn c++ and game development.


To Do List:

1. Add eyeball to the palyer character that follows the mouse

2. tie animations more closely to timing

3. add multiple animation pointers to each GameObject if they have multiple animations to switch between.

4. fix glitch where platforms get stuck on their transform boundaries
