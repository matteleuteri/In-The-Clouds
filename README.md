# In-The-Clouds

This is another game I am making to learn c++ and game development.


To Do List:

1. Add eyeball to the palyer character that follows the mouse

2. tie animations more closely to timing

4. fix glitch where platforms get stuck on their transform boundaries

5. represent transforms in matrix form instead of individual components

6. create an interface for timed events

7. when landing on a platform, use time in air and speed to get a better collision detection algorithm

8. use a camera object to define what region is rendered with respect to the scene

done list:

1. add multiple animation pointers to each GameObject if they have multiple animations to switch between.
